# Deep Learning aplicado a detecção/segmentação

- **Application of Deep Learning in defect Detection**
    - Wuhan KM Information Technology Co.
    - In this paper, the application of deep learning in defect detection of industrial products is analyzed and discussed. Meanwhile, the *traditional defect detection methods are summarized* and *compared with those using deep learning method.*
- **Deep Learning for Automated Visual Inspection in Manufacturing and Maintenance: A Survey of Open-Access Papers**
    - University of Wuppertal, Germany
    - Explores the question of *to what extent deep learning is already being used in the field of automated visual inspection* and which potential improvements to the state of the art could be realized utilizing concepts from academic research. By conducting an *extensive review of the openly accessible literature*, provides an overview of proposed and in-use deep-learning models presented in recent years.
- **Automated Visual Inspection of Aircraft Exterior Using Deep Learning**
    - Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São José dos Campos
    - *Uses deep neural networks for the detection and segmentation of defective regions*. This system will aid in the elimination of subjectivity caused by human errors and shorten the time required to inspect an aircraft, bringing benefits to its safety, maintenance, and operation.
